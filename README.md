# NETFLIX CLONE

# Design
- Getting the design perfect was a really hard one, but one thing i learnt is that every project will teach you something. I got to learn a lot, even things i never tought will look tough turned out to be harder than i think and like i said i learnt something new here

- Netflix responsiveness is morelike a static and not the fluid we are used to


# Future Features 
- Placeholder animation
